# Smile Classification

A set of simple examples of classification tasks implemented using [Smile](https://haifengl.github.io/smile/).

![Man smiling](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/smile-classification/blob/master/assets/smile2.jpeg)

Each example is self contained in its own package and object under `src/main/scala/<package name>`. The corresponding data and the description is under `src/main/resources/<package name>` and in this folder you'll find a thorough description of the dataset.

## Installation

The best way to run each example is to just import it in IntelliJ as an sbt project. You'll need:

- Scala 2.12.6.
- SBT 1.1.6
